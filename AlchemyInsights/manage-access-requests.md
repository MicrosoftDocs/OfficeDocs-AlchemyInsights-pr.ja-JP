# <a name="manage-access-requests"></a>アクセス依頼を管理する

When a user tries to access an item in SharePoint and they don't have permission, they'll see a message that they need permission to access the item. The user can request access (in some cases, to the specific item or to join the group) and a site owner can approve or decline the request. If someone who is not a site owner shares a site with another person, the site owner will also get an access request for the new user. To approve or decline access requests:
  
1. Go to the site, click the Settings icon in the upper right, and then click **Site Settings**. (If you don't see Site Settings, click **Site permissions**, and then click **Advanced permissions settings**. Look for a banner that has a link called "Show access requests and invitations.")
    
2. Under **Users and Permissions**, click **Access requests and invitations**. (If this doesn't appear, no access requests have been made.)
    
3. To give the user permission individually, click **Approve** or **Decline**. To select a specific permission level, first click the ellipsis (...) next to the person's name. Alternatively, add the user to a group that has permission to the site. For communication sites and classic team sites, you can do this on the Site Settings page. For sites that belong to a Microsoft 365 group, you can add the user to the group.
